# Cisco Secure Workload — FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program)
## Reference Design | Moderate Baseline & Continuous Monitoring Evidence

**Version:** 1.0  
**Use Case:** CSP or agency customer systems pursuing FedRAMP Authorization (P-ATO / ATO) with workload-tier controls  
**Baseline focus:** **FedRAMP Moderate** (most common for SaaS and IaaS at Moderate impact)

---

> **Coverage legend** — this reference design and its compliance report use three words:
> - 🟢 **Direct** — CSW produces the primary evidence artifact.
> - 🟠 **Supporting** — CSW produces an input that feeds or complements another control.
> - ⚪ **Evidence Required** *(supplied outside CSW)* — CSW produces nothing here; the item is in scope for compliance but out of scope for CSW, so the customer evidences it via another control, tool, or process. A scope boundary, not a gap or "unsupported."

## Reader's Guide

**Who this is for.** System owners, ISSOs, CSP security architects, and Third-Party Assessment Organization (3PAO) support teams documenting **technical evidence** for NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 controls in the **FedRAMP** context—especially information flow, boundary protection, vulnerability management inputs, configuration management, and continuous monitoring (ConMon).

**Questions this reference design helps you answer:**

- *How does CSW help satisfy **FedRAMP-scoped** parameters for **AC-4** (information flow enforcement) and **SC-7** (boundary protection) at the **workload** layer?*
- *What artifacts support **CA-7** continuous monitoring and annual assessment cycles without reducing everything to manual screenshots?*
- *How do **CM-2 / CM-3 / CM-8** narratives gain inventory and change-detection backing from CSW (ADM, drift, software inventory)?*
- *How can **RA-5** evidence incorporate **CVE awareness**, **EPSS**, and **attack-path / reachability** context from CSW?*
- *What can I put in a **POA&M** or closure package as automated evidence from CSW versus what still needs policy/procedure text?*

**What you'll need.** FIPS 199 categorization, draft **System Security Plan (SSP)** excerpts for in-scope controls, FedRAMP **Moderate** baseline control list, your **ConMon** strategy, integration plan for **SIEM** and ticketing, and **3PAO** evidence-format expectations.

**Where to start.** Sections 1–2 for FedRAMP overlay context; 3–8 for phased rollout; 9 for control mapping; 10–11 for boundaries, ConMon, POA&M, and 3PAO readiness.

**Critical note:** **Cisco Secure Workload (CSW) as a product/service is not itself FedRAMP-authorized.** This reference design describes how CSW deployed **on your system boundary** (customer responsibility) can produce **evidence** supporting **your** authorization package for **your** cloud system. CSPs must still map controls to inherited vs customer responsibility per the SSP.

## CSW primer — if you are new to Cisco Secure Workload

Cisco Secure Workload (CSW) is a **workload protection platform**. A lightweight **agent** on each server/VM/container observes processes and network flows; **cloud connectors** add AWS/Azure/GCP inventory where agents are not deployed.

| CSW term | Meaning | Why compliance teams care |
|----------|---------|---------------------------|
| **Scope** | Logical boundary (CDE, PHI zone, CUI enclave) | Defines the systems you must prove are isolated |
| **Label / filter** | Tag or query assigning workloads to scopes | Automates scope membership — reduces drift |
| **ADM** | Application Dependency Mapping from observed traffic | **Live** network/data-flow diagram for assessors |
| **Workspace** | Policy container for one scope or application | Where allow/deny rules are authored |
| **Monitor → Simulation → Enforce** | Safe rollout sequence | Simulation = change-board evidence before blocking traffic |
| **Denied Connections** | Log of flows blocked by policy | Primary proof that enforcement **operates** |

**Console areas:** Investigate (inventory, flows, vulns) · Defend/Segmentation (policy) · Manage (agents) · Platform (connectors) · Administration (audit log)

**Read next:** [Compliance evidence playbook](https://github.com/chandrapati/CSW-Compliance-Mapping/blob/main/docs/compliance-evidence-playbook.md) (full step-by-step) · [About CSW](https://github.com/chandrapati/CSW-Compliance-Mapping/blob/main/docs/about-csw.md) (platform intro)

## Universal evidence workflow

Execute these phases for **this framework's** compliance boundary. Map exports to control IDs in the **Reporting & Evidence** section below.

| Phase | Goal | Key CSW actions | Typical duration |
|-------|------|-----------------|------------------|
| **1 — Coverage** | Every in-scope workload in CSW | Install agents/connectors; apply compliance labels; create scope | Days 1–10 |
| **2 — Baseline** | Machine-generated flow map | Run ADM ≥2 weeks; export clusters; app-owner signoff | Days 11–28 |
| **3 — Policy** | Designed isolation before enforce | Build workspace; Simulation mode; fix false positives | Days 29–45 |
| **4 — Operate** | Continuous proof between audits | Enforce; quarterly export pack; ADM refresh every 90 days | Ongoing |

### Phase 1 checklist (coverage)

- [ ] In-scope host list reconciled to CSW Inventory (100% or documented exceptions)
- [ ] Labels applied: `compliance:<framework>`, `data:<classification>`, `env:<tier>`
- [ ] CSW scope created matching compliance boundary
- [ ] **Export:** inventory CSV + agent status screenshot

### Phase 2 checklist (baseline)

- [ ] ADM running on compliance scope for full business cycle (≥2 weeks)
- [ ] Unexpected flows documented (shadow IT, vendor egress, scope creep)
- [ ] App owners signed cluster-to-application mapping
- [ ] **Export:** ADM diagram + flow samples with process context

### Phase 3 checklist (policy)

- [ ] Default-deny posture defined for sensitive scope
- [ ] ADM-imported rules refined; Simulation run ≥1 week
- [ ] Change tickets for false-positive fixes; exception register updated
- [ ] **Export:** policy export + simulation report

### Phase 4 checklist (operate)

- [ ] Enforcement enabled on pilot scope; negative test recorded in Denied Connections
- [ ] Quarterly pack: inventory, policy, denies, vulns, audit log (see playbook)
- [ ] SIEM integration verified (sample events)
- [ ] **Export:** enforcement screenshot + quarterly binder

### What CSW evidence does not replace

Physical access, HR/training records, encryption key management, signed BAAs/vendor contracts, formal pen tests, and assessor attestation still require separate programmes. CSW addresses the **workload-resident** slice: segmentation, flows, process context, vuln reachability, and change drift.

---

## CSW effectiveness for this framework

- Moderate baseline AC-4/SC-7/CA-7/SI-4 with ConMon-ready exports
- POA&M inputs from gap and drift reports
- 3PAO assessment preparation artefacts

**Compared to manual programmes:** static diagrams and annual firewall samples age immediately; CSW ties evidence to **live workload behaviour** and produces queryable exports on demand — supporting "operating effectively" language in PCI v4.0, SOC 2 CC7, and HIPAA risk analysis.

---

## 1. Overview

FedRAMP authorizes cloud systems using **NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5** controls with **[FedRAMP baselines and parameters](https://www.fedramp.gov)**. This repo already includes [NIST 800-53 Rev 5 runbook coverage](https://github.com/chandrapati/CSW-Compliance-Mapping/blob/main/NIST-800-53/CSW-NIST-800-53-Technical-Runbook.md); this document adds **FedRAMP-specific** emphasis:

- **Moderate baseline** control expectations commonly evidenced in part by workload telemetry  
- **Continuous monitoring (ConMon)** rhythm (monthly operational visibility, POA&M hygiene, annual assessments)  
- **AC-4** and **SC-7** parameters that reference **enforcing approved information flows** and **boundary protection**—areas where CSW **microsegmentation** and **flow enforcement** directly contribute  
- **POA&M** and **3PAO** evidence conventions (machine-readable exports, sampling methodology)

### FedRAMP Moderate Themes → CSW Capabilities

| FedRAMP theme | NIST families (examples) | CSW capabilities |
|---|---|---|
| Enforce information flows | AC-3, **AC-4**, SC-7 | Workload allowlists, default-deny segments, ADM-backed approvals |
| Continuous visibility | **CA-7**, **SI-4**, AU-* | Continuous flow + process telemetry; alert forwarding |
| Baseline & change | **CM-2**, **CM-3**, CM-6, **CM-8** | ADM baseline; drift; software inventory reconciliation |
| Flaw / vuln management | **RA-5**, SI-2 | CVE visibility, scoring, **EPSS**, reachability-aware prioritization |
| IR support | IR-* | Forensic flow/process exports |

---

## 2. Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] **Authorization boundary** diagram updated (where CSW sensors/agents sit relative to major components)
- [ ] CSW cluster reachable from in-scope workloads (**egress 443** documented in SSP)
- [ ] **Customer vs CSP responsibility** table acknowledges CSW as customer-deployed tooling (if applicable)
- [ ] Identity for cloud connectors (AWS IAM, Azure SPN, GCP SA) follows **least privilege** (CM documentation)
- [ ] **SIEM** or **central log** destination approved for security event streaming (AU / SI-4 alignment)
- [ ] **Change management** process ready for sensor install and policy enforcement windows (**CM-2/CM-3**)
- [ ] **FedRAMP Moderate** control spreadsheet tagged with “CSW contributes (technical evidence)” rows

---

## 3. Phase 1 — Sensor Deployment (Days 1–5)

### 3.1 Linux Agent Install (Representative)

```bash
sudo rpm -ivh tet-sensor-<version>.rpm   # RHEL-family
# or
sudo dpkg -i tet-sensor-<version>.deb   # Debian-family

sudo systemctl enable --now csw-agent
systemctl status csw-agent
```

### 3.2 Windows

Deploy via signed MSI through your **CM-3**-controlled software channel; record the deployment in your change ticket.

### 3.3 Cloud

```
CSW UI → Platform → External Orchestrators
  → Connect AWS / Azure / GCP
  → Enable inventory + flow log ingestion per CSP documentation
```

### 3.4 FedRAMP Evidence — Deployment

| Artifact | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Agent inventory export with versions | CM-8 component tracking |
| Connector IAM/SPN policy JSON | AC-6 / CM-6 least-privilege evidence |
| Network allowlist proof (443 to CSW) | SC-7 / architecture appendix |

---

## 4. Phase 2 — Scope & Inventory Design (Days 6–12)

Align CSW **scopes** with **SSP segments** (e.g., web tier, app tier, data tier, management plane jump hosts).

### 4.1 Illustrative Scope Tree

```
FedRAMP-InScope
├── Management-Plane           # bastion, automation controllers
├── Ingress-Edge              # load balancers, API gateways (if instrumented)
├── App-Tier
├── Data-Tier
├── Security-Monitoring       # CSW, SIEM collectors (as applicable)
└── DevTest-OutOfScope        # explicitly excluded per boundary
```

### 4.2 Labels for CM-8 and RM Reconciliation

| Label | FedRAMP relevance |
|---|---|
| `ssp-component-id` | Map host to SSP attachment |
| `data-impact` | moderate / high (if multi-impact in same org) |
| `patch-group` | RA-5 remediation cadence |
| `change-window` | CM-3 correlation |

**Inventory reconciliation SOP:**

```text
1. Export CSW inventory (monthly)
2. Compare to CMDB / CSP asset API
3. Document deltas: new = change review; missing = decommission proof
4. Attach summary to ConMon monthly package
```

---

## 5. Phase 3 — Visibility & Baseline (Days 13–28)

### 5.1 ADM for Approved Information Flows (AC-4 / SC-7)

```
CSW UI → Investigate → Application Dependency Mapping
  → Workspace: "FedRAMP-Baseline-<SystemAcronym>-<YYYYMM>"
  → Scope: FedRAMP-InScope (exclude DevTest-OutOfScope)
  → Duration: ≥ 30 days recommended for Moderate systems with monthly batch jobs
```

**Document:** “Approved flows” = ADM clusters **plus** signed architecture diagrams **plus** change tickets for exceptions.

### 5.2 Baseline Drift as Change Signal (CM-2 / CM-3)

```
CSW UI → Investigate → ADM
  → Compare current window to baseline workspace
  → New external destinations or cross-tier paths → open CM ticket if unexplained
```

---

## 6. Phase 4 — Policy Design (Weeks 5–7)

### 6.1 AC-4 / SC-7 — Information Flow & Boundary (FedRAMP Parameters)

FedRAMP parameters for **AC-4** and **SC-7** expect **documented enforcement** of authorized communications. CSW contributes **workload-level** enforcement **inside** the authorization boundary.

**Example policy pattern (conceptual):**

```
# Default deny between tiers except ADM-approved paths
DENY: App-Tier → Data-Tier (default)
ALLOW: App-Tier → Data-Tier (tcp/5432 to approved DB pool scope only)
ALLOW: Management-Plane → App-Tier (tcp/22 from Jump-Host subnet only — document in SSP)

# Management ingress tightly constrained
DENY: Internet → Management-Plane

# Log residual unmatched flows for SI-4 monitoring
LOG: unmatched flows → soc-queue
```

Translate into your **Defend → Segmentation** workspace; run **Simulation** until exceptions are chartered.

### 6.2 Simulation → Enforcement Gates (CA-2 / CA-7 Support)

| Gate | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Simulation report | Shows blast-radius analysis before enforcement |
| CAB approval | CM-3 change record |
| Enforcement cutover | Policy version export + timestamp |

---

## 7. Phase 5 — Enforcement & Continuous Operations

### 7.1 CA-7 — Continuous Monitoring Hooks

FedRAMP ConMon expects **ongoing** insight into control effectiveness. Use CSW outputs on a **monthly** (minimum) cadence:

| Activity | Control families bolstered |
|---|---|
| Export policy workspace version + diff | AC-3, AC-4, SC-7 |
| Vulnerability report scoped to prod | RA-5, SI-2 |
| Alert summary with MTTR | SI-4, IR-4 |
| Inventory vs CMDB reconciliation | CM-8 |
| ADM refresh / drift log | CM-2, CM-3 |

### 7.2 SI-4 — System Monitoring

Forward alerts with **5-tuple**, **process context**, **policy action**, and **workload identity** to your **SIEM** for daily SOC review (AU-6 alignment).

```bash
# Example pattern: verify SIEM HTTP Event Collector from build pipeline
# curl -sk "$SPLUNK_HEC_URL/services/collector/health" -H "Authorization: Splunk $HEC_TOKEN"
```

---

## 8. Phase 6 — RA-5 Vulnerability Management & Reachability

### 8.1 CSW Vulnerability & Prioritization Workflow

```
CSW UI → Investigate → Vulnerability Report
  → Scope: FedRAMP-InScope production
  → Sort: CVSS descending
  → Layer: reachability / exposure context where available
  → Export: CSV for POA&M bulk references
```

### 8.2 EPSS and Exploit Awareness

When your deployment exposes **EPSS** or threat-intel overlays, document how **RA-5** prioritization uses **exploit likelihood** plus **CSW reachability** (not CVSS alone).

### 8.3 POA&M-Ready Fields

For each open finding, capture: **CVE**, **asset ID**, **CSW scope**, **first seen**, **compensating control** (e.g., microsegment blocking exploit path), **planned patch date**.

---

## 9. Control Mapping: FedRAMP (Moderate) → CSW → Evidence

| Control | Name (summary) | FedRAMP nuance | CSW capability | Evidence produced |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **AC-4** | Information Flow Enforcement | Parameterized flow enforcement expectations | Microsegmentation; ADM-documented flows | Policy export; ADM diagrams; simulation reports |
| **AC-3** | Access Enforcement | Often paired with AC-4 narratives | Workload-level allow/deny | Enforcement logs |
| **CA-7** | Continuous Monitoring | ConMon deliverables to FedRAMP PMO / agency | Scheduled exports; dashboards | Monthly ConMon slide pack attachments |
| **CM-2** | Baseline Configuration | Baseline reviews | ADM baseline workspace | Baseline vs current comparison |
| **CM-3** | Configuration Change Control | Changes authorized | Drift alerts → tickets | Ticket IDs linked to CSW events |
| **CM-8** | System Component Inventory | Accurate inventory | CSW inventory export | Reconciliation spreadsheet |
| **RA-5** | Vulnerability Monitoring | Scanning + remediation tracking | CVE + CVSS + EPSS + reachability views | Vuln CSV; POA&M rows |
| **SC-7** | Boundary Protection | Parameterized boundary definitions | Segmentation between tiers / mgmt | Topology + policy mapping |
| **SI-4** | System Monitoring | Ongoing monitoring | Process + flow telemetry | SIEM ingest proof; sample alerts |
| **AU-2/3/6/12** | Audit events & review | Centralized logging | Rich flow/process audit records | Field mapping doc; retention S3/Splunk |
| **IR-4** | Incident Handling | Response evidence | Forensic export bundles | Incident attachment set |

### 9.1 FedRAMP Parameters — AC-4 and SC-7 (Workload Tier)

FedRAMP control narratives and parameters expect you to **approve** information flows and **protect** boundaries. In practice, assessors look for:

1. **Written policy** defining authorized communication paths (who may talk to whom, on which ports and protocols).  
2. **Technical enforcement** consistent with that policy—not only “we have a firewall at the edge.”  
3. **Evidence of operation**: logs showing denies/alerts, change control when paths change, and periodic review.

**How CSW fits:** Use **ADM** to derive the **observed** application graph, reconcile it to the **approved** architecture in the SSP, then encode the delta in **segmentation workspaces**. For **SC-7**, position CSW as **internal segmentation** and **host-level boundary** enforcement **within** the FedRAMP authorization boundary (complements VPC/VNet edges, NGFWs, and cloud native controls). Always cite **inheritance** where the CSP’s FedRAMP authorization covers hypervisor or backbone controls.

### 9.2 CA-7 Continuous Monitoring — Operationalizing CSW

FedRAMP ConMon emphasizes **ongoing authorization**. Map CSW activities to your **ConOps** (not only annual assessment):

| ConMon activity | Example CSW artifact |
|---|---|
| Vulnerability disposition | Weekly scoped vulnerability export; POA&M linkage |
| Significant change detection | ADM drift summary after major releases |
| Incident trend | Alert volume / MTTR with sample forensic exports |
| Inventory accuracy | CSW ↔ CMDB reconciliation signed by ISSO |

---

## 10. Boundaries — What CSW Does **Not** Cover

- **FedRAMP authorization for CSW itself:** Using CSW does not inherit FedRAMP for the Cisco service; your SSP must state inheritance and responsibilities correctly.
- **Complete Moderate baseline:** Many controls are **policy, personnel, physical, or IAM-console** tasks outside CSW (e.g., full **AT-*** training records).
- **Independent scanning tools:** RA-5 often still requires **authenticated scanner** exports; CSW **complements** with exposure context, not wholesale replacement of scanner SOPs.
- **Encryption validation:** CSW can flag some **cleartext** protocols; **cryptographic module validation** references **FIPS 140** separately ([FIPS runbook](https://github.com/chandrapati/CSW-Compliance-Mapping/blob/main/FIPS-140/CSW-FIPS-Technical-Runbook.md) in this repo).
- **CSP control inheritance:** Customer Dedicated vs FedRAMP High Lift varies; always reconcile with **FedRAMP Marketplace** authorization for your underlying cloud.

---

## 11. Audit Preparation, ConMon, POA&M, and 3PAO Evidence

### 11.1 Continuous Monitoring (ConMon) Content Pack

Prepare a **recurring** folder structure your ISSO can upload or email per FedRAMP guidance:

```text
ConMon-YYYY-MM/
  ├── 00-cover-sheet.docx
  ├── csw-inventory-export-YYYY-MM-DD.csv
  ├── csw-policy-workspace-<name>-vNN-export.json|pdf
  ├── csw-vuln-report-YYYY-MM-DD.csv
  ├── csw-adm-drift-summary-YYYY-MM.pdf
  ├── siem-ingest-health-screenshot.png
  └── poam-delta-summary.xlsx   # new/closed rows referencing CSW IDs
```

### 11.2 POA&M Evidence from CSW

| POA&M scenario | CSW evidence |
|---|---|
| Delayed patch on internet-facing tier | Vuln report row + compensating deny rule + expiration date |
| New unexpected listener | Process/listener report + CM ticket |
| Segmentation gap found in test | Simulation report + enforced policy version after fix |

### 11.3 3PAO Assessment Preparation

- **Sampling plan:** Provide assessors **N** random alerts with **full flow + process** exports (not cropped images).  
- **Tracing:** For each sampled control (e.g., AC-4), show **SSP narrative paragraph → CSW policy row → live log line** alignment.  
- **Independence:** 3PAO validates; your team supplies **read-only** access or redacted exports per rules of engagement.

### 11.4 Bash / API Documentation Snippets for Engineers

```bash
# Document agent freshness for assessors (run from jump host with CLI access if enabled)
# csw-agent-health.sh — pseudo-example; replace with your supported health endpoint
curl -sS "https://<csw-api>/api/v1/agents?scope=FedRAMP-InScope" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CSW_API_TOKEN" \
  | jq '.results[] | {hostname, version, last_seen}'

# Archive monthly evidence
tar czf "csw-conmon-$(date +%Y-%m).tgz" ConMon-$(date +%Y-%m)/
```

### 11.5 Reporting & Evidence Collection (Assessment Cycle)

| Evidence item | CSW source | Typical control hooks |
|---|---|---|
| Information-flow enforcement log | Defend → Policy Analysis / enforcement history | AC-4, SC-7 |
| Flow audit trail (in-scope) | Investigate → Flow Search | AU-*, SI-4 |
| Policy violation / deny events | Alerts | AC-3, SC-7, IR-4 |
| Patch-priority report | Investigate → Vulnerability | RA-5, SI-2 |
| Baseline vs current graph | Investigate → ADM | CM-2, CM-3 |
| Workload inventory snapshot | Manage → Inventory export | CM-8 |

Schedule **monthly** inventory reconciliation and **quarterly** policy workspace review; align frequency to your **ConMon** plan and agency requirements.

---

## 12. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Claiming CSW satisfies AC-4/SC-7 without SSP linkage | Add **explicit** SSP subsections mapping components → CSW scopes → policy workspace IDs. |
| Screenshots-only evidence for 3PAO | Provide **exports** (CSV/JSON/PDF) with timestamps and scope metadata. |
| Treating CSW reachability as a replacement for RA-5 scanning | Keep **authenticated scanner** outputs; use CSW for **prioritization** and exposure context. |
| Skipping simulation on production | Run **Simulation**; attach CAB tickets to enforcement changes (CM-3). |
| Out-of-date ADM after every major release | Re-baseline ADM per release; file drift summary with change record. |
| Confusing vendor FedRAMP with your system ATO | Document CSW as **customer responsibility** or **dependency** per [FedRAMP Marketplace](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov) due diligence. |
